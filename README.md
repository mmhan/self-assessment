# Self Assessment Guide

This documentation is a result of the work I have done in order to optimize our performance review process at Rebbiz Development Team. I do not claim that this is my original idea, in fact, it's a collage of many best practices I have observed from the industry over the years.

## Why do you need to do self-assessment?

- Each employee in your organization should reflect on oneself periodically to understand whether they are performing to their fullest potential.

- Every managers that is supervising should also reflect on oneself as well as oversee the self-assessment of those below him/her.
- Once the self-assessments are done ensure that the manager and the employees engage in a conversation in order to maximize efficiency. The length of the conversation should vary depending on the frequency of self-assessment made as well as the professional relationship between the manager and the employee.
	- When manager doesn't agree the high rating that the employee has given himself, talk to him to let him understand which are the areas that the employee is not meeting the expectations.
	- When an employee is stuck at ratings 3 or below for more than a couple of weeks, it means he is not happy at doing his job/he's not satisfied with the job he's doing. Perhaps, that should be a signal that tells the manager that he is not assigning work properly.

## Tools

You may use any tool to do assessment on yourself. I recommend creating
a simple google form file to keep track of your assessment ratings. Thus
it will allow you to create line charts of your ratings which will allow
you to analyze your performance better.
